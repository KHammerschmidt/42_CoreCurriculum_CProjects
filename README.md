## ðŸ’¡  About the core curriculum @ 42Heilbronn
> The core curriculum of the programming school 42Heilbronn consists of various projects that tackle concepts of imperative and object-oriented programming, network and system administration and many more. For more information visit: https://www.42heilbronn.de/de/.  </br>

>The projects presented in this repository are all written in C and C++98 and taught me to develop programs using classic algorithms, to discover the file system and to learn UNIX process management. In addition, there are graphic projects included which run with 42's graphic library minilibx.
