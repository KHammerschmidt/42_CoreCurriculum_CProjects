# push_swap

Task: Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard ouput the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers on a stack received as arguments.

Scenario: You have 2 stacks: a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers without any duplicates, stack b is empty. Sort stack a in ascending order numbers with a series the following operations: 
swap or push elements from one stack to another, as well as rotate and reverse rotate a stack.

Key learning points of this project were:
- Handling linked lists
- Getting familiar with sorting algorithms
- Getting acquainted with bit-shifting

Use:
To compile the project use the command make.
