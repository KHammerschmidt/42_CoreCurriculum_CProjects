# get_next_line

Task: Write a project with maximum of 10 functions under the 42 norminette restrictions, that reads one line from a file descriptor with varying BUFFER_SIZE.
Thereby, only one line should be returned and any remains after the newline should be saved for a repetitive function call. 
The standard library functions can be found in ../libft/src/ 

Key learning points of this project were:
  - Getting familiar with file descriptors and reading from a file
  - Using static variables

Compile with: make
