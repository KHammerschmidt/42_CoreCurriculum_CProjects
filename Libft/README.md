# Libft

Task: Re-coding my own library with standard functions of the C library (libc) and some utility functions needed for later projects.

Key learning points of this project were:
  - Handling different variable types and memory allocation
  - Passing on various types of input and typecasting void pointers
  - Setting up a Makefile to compile my library
  - Familiarise myself with linked lists

 Use:
 To compile the library use the command 'make'.
 To compile bonus functions use 'make bonus'.
